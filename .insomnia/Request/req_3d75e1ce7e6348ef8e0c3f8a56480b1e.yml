  ## *Subscription*

  A subscription is the compound of selected product - intended as set of plan and options -, customer, and terminal.

  ### Products

  A subscription includes all products purchased by a single customer, for example:
   + plans,
   + add-ons, and
   + options.
  ### Technical Details

  A __first subscription__ is a new subscription for a not existing customer, and, when creating a first subscription, 

  the API requests all the __customer details__, but not the __customer ID__, which is unknown.

  A __new subscription__ is a subscription creation request for an existing customer, and, during the subscription 

  creation flow, the API requests only the __customer ID__.

  ___

  ## *Plan*

  A plan is the main product, and it provides an amount of data allowance, including a defined speed and a validity 

  period, and it is available in a selected number of countries. When the available data allowance finishes, the 

  internal platform applies restraints and policies.

  ### Plan ID

  The internal platform assigns a primary and unique identifier to each plan, which is an 8 lowercase characters 

  alphanumeric string. When performing the __change plan__ for a subscription or creating a __new subscription__, 

  the system requires this ID.

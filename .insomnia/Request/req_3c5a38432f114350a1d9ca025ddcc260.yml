  ## *Add-On*

  An add-on is an additional volume package, that a customer may request in order to avoid navigation restraints. 

  It is possible to assign an add-on type to a subscription through a specific API request. The internal platform 

  links through this assignment the add-on instance to the subscription.

  After assignment completion, it is possible to get the list of the assigned add-ons containing the add-on instance.

  ### Add-On Type

  For each subscription, there are several add-on types available for services, which allow the API client to request 

  the best additional data allowance for a subscription.

  ___

  ## *Subscription*

  A subscription is the compound of selected product - intended as set of plan and options -, customer, and terminal.

  ### Products

  A subscription includes all products purchased by a single customer, for example:
   + plans,
   + add-ons, and
   + options.
  ### Technical Details

  A __new subscription__ is a subscription creation request for an existing customer, and, during the subscription 

  creation flow, the API requests only the __customer ID__.

description: >-
  Allows to change the status of the given subscription.

  ## *Status Flow*

  The status of a subscription indicates the current step of the subscription lifecycle. A subscription can switch through 

  multiple statuses which are detailed below:

  + __Pending Activation__
      + Upon signing the contract, the system creates a subscription that is not effective until the activation. At this 
      stage, the internal platform allows to perform some actions, but not navigation.
  + __Cancelled__
      + A subscription can be cancelled only if it has never been activated. In this case the customer terminates the 
      contract before activating the subscription.
  + __Active__
      + At this stage of the subscription lifecycle, the customer activates the terminal through the given activation key, 
      during the self-activation procedure. After activating the subscription, the customer can benefit from the 
      selected product.
  + __Suspended__
      + The distributor can suspend a subscription, and block the navigation.
  + __Expired__
      + When a customer terminates the contract, but the subscription has been previously activated, the subscription 
      expires. This status can be generated from an active, or a suspended status.



      
  ### Change Status

  In order to set a new status of the subscription lifecycle, it is necessary to call the change status action. 

  It is possible to set a date to book the status change, in case the change date field is empty, it is valued with 

  the current date. It is possible to set, modify, or abort a change status through specific API requests.

  It is only possible to perform the following changes of status:

  * from __pending activation__ to __cancelled__;

  * from __active__ to __suspended__;

  * from __suspended__ to __active__;

  * from __active__ or __suspended__ to __expired__.
